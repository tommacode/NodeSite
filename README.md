# The new site

## Description

Here will eventually be the new website for TomBlake.me. I plan to write this in node and make it easy to update the content.

## Roadmap

- Get the static HTML and CSS working and getting it served up correctly.
- Make it possible to use a style sheet but it be added to the HTML before being sent to the client
- Add connections to the backend that will load new content

## Known issues

- None
