# The new site

## Description

Here will eventually be the new website for TomBlake.me. I plan to write this in node and make it easy to update the content.

## Roadmap

- Get the static HTML and CSS working and getting it served up correctly.
- Make it possible to use a style sheet but it be added to the HTML before being sent to the client
- Add connections to the backend that will load new content
- Create a backend that will read and write to a database with the projects that have been written

## Possible Ideas

- Add logs to easily monitor the performance of the site and work out where traffic is comming from
- Make articles editable. When you go to create article it will offer other articles in a similar way to how it does on the nav page. Then you can select one and it will load it into the boxes. Then you can select weather to edit or create a new one

## Known issues

- None
